# The Password Generator

The code in this repo designs and deploys a site that allows users to generate their own random, secure password that meets certain 
criteria. It allows users to choose not only the length of the new password, but also what kind of characters the password will include.
The site can be found here: [Password Generator](https://grandmaster.github.io/Password-Generator).

## Installation
The site can be run on any modern browser.

## Usage
Upon arriving at the site, the user clicks on the large red button to begin the password generation process. The site prompts the user
for some information to use in constructing the password, like its length and what characters to include in it. Once all the prompts 
have been answered, the site generates a password and prints it to the center area of the site, to be used by the user. The site looks like this:
